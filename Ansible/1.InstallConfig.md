 # Installation and Configuration

## Step 1 - Installing Ansible

 To configure the PPA on your machine and install ansible run these commands:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install ansible

  Check ansible install version

    $ ansible --version

## Step 2 - Configure Hosts

All host information is kept in the hosts files as follows

    $ sudo gedit /etc/ansible/hosts

    $ sudo gedit /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

    Remove comment of inventory and the sudo_user
    Its default but better to change and make it apply


    $ cat /etc/ansible/hosts

    $ sudo mv hosts hosts.original

    $ sudo gedit hosts

    Create entries of the hosts which you are going to manage

          [local]
          localhost

          [itlab6]
          10.0.1.198
          10.0.1.197

Note : Better to use Vi than gedit


Ansible Default configuration
        $ cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

        Keep as it is or you can uncomment following and save
        #inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
        #sudo_user      = root

-------------------------------------

## Step 3 - Servers Setup

  ### Install ssh on the server and your host also

    $ sudo apt install ssh

    Check from your computer to server you can connect using the ssh

    $ ssh dbit@10.0.1.198

    This will ask username and password



### This is not necessary to just for additional information
### If you want to enable root login on over ssh then follow following commands

    # gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    Change the line "PermitRootLogin" to "yes"

    # service sshd restart

    $ ssh root@192.168.1.101

    You will be able to connect to the server using root username

### Create ansible user with sudo permissions

 On the server where you will be configuring you need to have a user with sudo permissions and authentication method must not need password. i.e use ssh keys

    # sudo adduser ansible
    # sudo usermod -aG sudo ansible

### Setup ssh keys

      On the OUR computer AND WITH ANSIBLE USER ( Create if not not available )
      from where we will be managing ansible

      Swith to the user using following command

      $ su ansible

    Then start commands

      $ ssh-keygen
        accept all default options

      $ cd /home/ansible/.ssh/
       you can see all keys here at this place

       Copy the Public Key on server where we created ansible user

       $ ssh-copy-id ansible@192.168.1.101
       Input password

      $ ssh-copy-id tayyabali@localhost
      $ ssh-copy-id ansible@localhost
      $ ssh-copy-id ansible@10.0.1.198
      $ ssh-copy-id ansible@10.0.1.197

      Now try

      $ ssh ansible@192.168.1.198
      $ ssh localhost

      You will be logged in without password

### Disable Password Authentication (Recommended) not necessary now
      On Server (Where we have ansible user):
      Now oce you have configured the key based login, now you can disable the password based auth

      $ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

      Change follwoing parameter to no as shown below

          PasswordAuthentication no

      $ sudo systemctl reload sshd

### Set Up a Basic Firewall

    $ sudo ufw app list
    $ sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    $ sudo ufw enable
    $ sudo ufw status


Now lets configure ansible user to run commands as a root on the remote machine

    $ sudo visudo

    add following below the User privilege section, just below the root
    ansible  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

    CTRL + O  ----> Enter to Save  and CTRL + X


    and then check if its ok
    $ sudo visudo -c

    Check if you can be root without the password

    $ su ansible -

-------------------------------------
