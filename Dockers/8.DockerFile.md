## Docker File

    $ docker images
    $ docker ps

Stop containers if any running

    $ docker stop CONTAINER_ID/NAME

Lets Cleanup all the containers and keep only images

    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`
    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker ps

Lets build a directory for our build

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ docker images
We only now have images

Create a file in build directory
    $ vi Dockerfile

Put followig text in the Dockerfile

    FROM debian:stable
    MAINTAINER tayyabali <tayyabsayyad@gmail.com>
    RUN apt-get update
    RUN apt-get upgrade
    RUN apt-get install telnet

Then lets build the image using followig command

    $ build$ docker build -t tayyabali/myapache .

You may see this is failed because of the questions it asks

      Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Abort

If build is failed you have only latest debian image available as you can see

      $ docker images

But what happens if we try to pur a unknow command in the file as shown below and build image

    FROM debian:stable
    MAINTAINER tayyabali <tayyabsayyad@gmail.com>
    RUN apt-get update
    RUN apt-get upgrade
    RUN apt-get install telnet
    RUN my-command

Docker uses cache memory for the image layer, When you run commands separately image layers are increased good to combine command together as following


    FROM debian:stable
    MAINTAINER tayyabali <tayyabsayyad@gmail.com>
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y telnet apache2 elinks openssh-server

Check the build image

    $ docker images

Lets add envirnment variables and file looks as followig

    FROM debian:stable
    MAINTAINER tayyabali <tayyabsayyad@gmail.com>

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y telnet apache2 elinks openssh-server

    ENV MYVALUE my-value

and build image again

    $ docker build -t tayyabali/myapache .

    It will build quickly becaue it used cache

Lets make container from the image

    $ docker run -it tayyabali/myapache:latest /bin/bash

and check the envirnment variable in container, you can see the value

    $ root@3012264990e9:/# echo $MYVALUE
    my-value

This is the way how you can pass variable in the container which is instantiated

Lets Clean up again

    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`
    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker ps

Lets chane the Dockerfile as follows to expose the ports

    FROM debian:stable
    MAINTAINER tayyabali <tayyabsayyad@gmail.com>

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y telnet apache2 elinks openssh-server

    ENV MYVALUE my-value

    EXPOSE 80
    EXPOSE 22

and build the image again

    $ docker build -t tayyabali/myapache .

Lets create the continer based on the image created

    $ docker run -it tayyabali/myapache:latest /bin/bash

Open New Terminal and see ports are now open

    $ docker ps

Exit from the container and remove the container

    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`
    $ docker ps -a
    $ docker ps

Starting apache in the container

Remove the port 22 we dont need that to be exposed and add command to start apache as follows

      FROM debian:stable
      MAINTAINER tayyabali <tayyabsayyad@gmail.com>

      RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install -y telnet apache2 elinks openssh-server

      ENV MYVALUE my-value

      EXPOSE 80

      CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl","-D","FOREGROUND"]

Build the image again

    $ docker build -t tayyabali/myapache .

Now once image is built make container as follows, we will run in the -d mode as we have executed commands in the continer

    $ docker run -d tayyabali/myapache:latest
    $ docker ps
    $ docker inspect CONTAINER_ID

    Now check the apache page

    $ elinks 172.17.0.2

  Now you can do port redirection, valume management

  You can also connect to the container as follows

    $ docker exec -it fervent_visvesvaraya /bin/bash
    root@c4ecaf1aa2fe:/# ps aux | grep apache
    root@c4ecaf1aa2fe:/# echo $MYVALUE

See apache is running and MYVALUE is also set

    Exit and check ps it will be still running

    root@c4ecaf1aa2fe:/# exit
    $ docker ps
