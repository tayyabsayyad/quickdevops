## Display information of the specified image in JSON format.   
    $ docker inspect (PACKAGE NAME)

## Shows current running Docker containers.
    $ docker ps

## This command removes base images (rmi) that weren't used with any containers.
    $ docker rmi (BASE IMAGE)

## Creates a container running in the background with a volume (-v) mounting point that can be mounted while the container is running.
    $ docker run -d -v (MOUNT POINT) (BASE IMAGE)

## Will search Docker Hub, from a terminal, for the key word a user is searching for.
    $ docker search (KEY WORD)
